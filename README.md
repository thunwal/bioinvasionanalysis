## Environment setup

You need to clone the default arcgispro-py3 environment because it is not possible to add packages to the default 
environment. Follow [these](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/3.0/arcpy/get-started/clone-an-environment.htm) steps.

Next - in a PyCharm project -, add the file Python.exe in the newly created path as the project interpreter via 
Settings > Project > Python Interpreter > Add Interpreter > Add Local Interpreter > Virtualenv environment > Existing.
